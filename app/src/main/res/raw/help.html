<p>
    The LoRaWAN gateway mobile app works with the RAK2287 device connected to the USB port of the phone (tablet).
</p>

<p>
    Run the application.
</p>

<p>
    The gateway on-off switch will become active when the RAK2287 is connected via the USB connector
    and the right to use the USB device will be granted.
</p>


<p>
    Connect the RAK2287 to a USB port on your phone (tablet).
</p>

<p>
    If necessary, use micro-USB, mini-USB or Type-C adapters.
</p>

<p>
    The gateway consumes a significant amount of power and quickly drains the battery of the phone (tablet).
    If necessary, use the USB adapter with the charger.
</p>

<p>
    When connecting RAK2287, a dialog box will appear asking for the rights to connect the detected USB device.
    Confirm that you have granted the right.
</p>

<p>
    Select the desired region from the list.
</p>

<p>
    Turn gateway switch to the on position.
</p>

<p>
    Gateway events are displayed.
